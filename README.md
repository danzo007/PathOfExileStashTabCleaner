<H2>Additional notes:</H2>

- The script only works when the Path of Exile window is selected.
- The script does not work without AutoHotkey.
- You can change the hotkey for starting and stopping the script. Just open the script file "PathOfExileStashTabCleaner_v1" in any text editor, and change the hotkey in lines 2/32 from F5/F6 to any other hotkey combination. For example, if you want to set the hotkey to "Ctrl+Alt+X", change it to "^!x".
